# Raven child theme

## Installation

1. Upload the Raven child theme folder via FTP to your wp-content/themes/ directory. (The Genesis parent theme needs to be in the wp-content/themes/ directory as well.)

2. Go to your WordPress dashboard and select Appearance.

3. Activate the Raven child theme.

4. Inside your WordPress dashboard, go to Genesis > Theme Settings and configure them to your liking.

Note: After you download and unarchive the theme from GitHub, you may want to rename the raven-master folder to raven. (optional)

## Widget Areas

Raven comes with 3 widget areas:

1. Welcome Text. Appears on the front page above the posts area. Use a text widget.

2. Before Entry. Appears before a post on single post pages. Use a text widget.

3. After Entry. Appears after a post on single post pages. Use a text widget or Genesis eNews Extended widget.

## Image Sizes

Raven uses the following image sizes:

1. mini-square (80x80)
2. square (100x100)
3. large-square (120x120)

## Primary Navigation Extras

As of Genesis 2.1, the Primary Navigation Extras options have been removed for new installs. (upgrades of current installs to 2.1 will not lose the Primary Navigation Extras settings)

The prefered method of adding custom links like Twitter or RSS is to use a custom menu item and give it a CSS class of right.

Raven includes support for the Genericons icon font for use with the Primary Navigation Extras. The list of supported icon fonts are:

1. CodePen
2. Dribble
3. Email
4. Facebook
5. Flickr
6. Foursquare
7. GitHub
8. Google+
9. Instagram
10. LinkedIn
11. Pinterest
12. Reddit
13. RSS
14. StumbleUpon
15. Tumblr
16. Twitter
17. Vimeo
18. WordPress
19. YouTube

For example, to add a Twitter link, add a custom link to your menu and in the CSS Classes input field enter right twitter. Refer to the theme docs for details.

## Content Boxes

The custom content boxes make use of DIV classes. For example ...

	<div class="content-box-blue">some random text</div>

There are 8 styles to choose from. Refer to the style sheet for details.

## Gradient Buttons

Each button has a unique class. For example ...

	<a class="button-green" href="#">Link Text</a>

The above will render the Green button. There are 11 styles to choose from. Refer to the style sheet for details.

## Header Area Image
Raven uses a logo in the header area which you will find in the theme's image folder. Create a new image with the same dimensions. To display it navigate to Genesis > Theme Settings and select "Image logo" from the drop down menu.
